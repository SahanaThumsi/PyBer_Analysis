###### Rural cities have the highest Average fair per ride compared to urban and suburban cities
###### Rural cities also have the highest Average fair per driver compared to urban and suburban cities
###### Rural cities have the lowest Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares compared other type of cities


## Three Business Recomendations for CEO Addressing Disparities among city types.
- Month of april for rural cities can be focused on to see why fares are higher compared to other months
- suburban cities need to check why fares have reduced after april begins
- Urban cities can work on how to improve rides from january to mid of febuary
